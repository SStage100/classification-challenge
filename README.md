Module 13 Challenge
Spam Detection Project

Hi there! Welcome to my Spam Detection project. This project was all about building models to figure out if an email is spam or not. I used two different models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—to see which one could do the job better. Below, you’ll find everything you need to know about this project, from getting started to understanding the results.

The main steps in the project were:

 1. Loading and Exploring the Data: I started by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and took a quick look at the data to understand its structure.
 2. Data Preprocessing: This involved splitting the data into training and testing sets, scaling the features, and preparing the data for modeling.
 3. Building Models: I created two models: a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest model.
 4. Evaluating the Models: After training the models, I compared their accuracy to see which one performed better.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to compare two machine learning models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—to see which one does a better job at detecting spam emails. I started by predicting which model I thought would perform better and then went ahead to train, test, and compare the models.

Getting Started
If you want to run this project on your own machine, here’s what you’ll need to do:

Prerequisites
 1. Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python installed.
 2. Libraries: You’ll need the following Python libraries:
pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - You can install these libraries using pip if you don’t have them already:
pip install pandas scikit-learn


Running the Project
 1. Clone the repository: (If this is in a GitHub repo, provide the link here)
 2. Open the project in your IDE: I used Jupyter Notebook, but any Python environment should work.
 3. Run the notebook: Start from the top, and work your way down. Each cell builds on the last, so make sure to run them in order!

Data
The dataset I used comes from the UCI Machine Learning Library. It’s all about different features in emails that might help figure out if they’re spam or not. Here’s a quick look at what’s inside:

 1. Features: The dataset includes various word frequencies, character frequencies, and other features related to email content.
 2. Target: The spam column, where 1 means the email is spam and 0 means it’s not.
You can check out the dataset here.

Models Used
I used two models for this project:

 1. Logistic Regression: This is a simple model that works well for binary classification problems like this one.

 2. Random Forest: This model is a bit more complex, using multiple decision trees to make predictions. It’s great for capturing more detailed patterns in the data.

Results
After training and testing both models, here’s what I found:

 1. Logistic Regression Accuracy: 92.73%
 2. Random Forest Accuracy: 95.87%

As I expected, the Random Forest model performed better. It’s more powerful because it combines the predictions of many decision trees, which helps it catch more complex patterns.

Next Steps
If I were to continue working on this project, here are a few things I might do:

 1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Tweaking the settings of the models to see if I can squeeze out even better performance.
 2. Try Other Models: Experimenting with different models like SVM or Gradient Boosting.
 3. Balance the Dataset: Since there were more non-spam emails than spam emails, it might be worth balancing the dataset to see if it improves results.

Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience for me as someone new to Python and machine learning. I learned how to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance. I hope this README gives you a good overview of what I did and how you can try it out yourself. Thanks for checking out my project!
